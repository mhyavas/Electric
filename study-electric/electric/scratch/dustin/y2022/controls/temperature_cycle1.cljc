; L: the problem is how to express causality cycles in a photon program

  (let [!temperature (atom 0) temperature (p/watch !temperature)]
    (->> (ui/input {::ui/value temperature})
         js/parseFloat
         (reset! !temperature))))

  (let [!conn (atom {}) db (p/watch !conn)]
    (let [v (js/parseFloat (ui/input {::ui/value (:user/temperature db)}))]
      (swap! !conn {} {:user/temperature v})))) ; lose history

  (let [!conn (d/connect ...) db (p/watch !conn)]
    (let [v (js/parseFloat (ui/input {::ui/value (:user/temperature (d/entity db 1))}))]

; loop/recur is not about creating cycles
; it's about causality chains whose length is dynamic â€“ unlike p/for




(let [!conn (atom {}) db (p/watch !conn)])

(p/defn App []
