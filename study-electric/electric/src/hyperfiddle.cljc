(ns hyperfiddle)

; See discussion of single-segment namespaces here
; https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide/pull/100
; Clojure is fine if no gen-class
; ClojureScript compiler warns
; Just use hyperfiddle.api :as hf, for specs as well as fns,
; it's a little ugly but with the require alias it works out.
