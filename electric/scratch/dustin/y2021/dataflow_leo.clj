; What is clojure compatibility?
; Expect from HFDL to be able to use existing macros including clojure.core macros, destructuring
; if use destructure in let, desugar to get/next/first
; s-expressions and ordinary let bindings
; expect this to work incrementally â€“ if the input changes, then the result will be propogated to the apply node
; that computes the next value (call to next). Want the compiler to figure out that next is clojure.core fn , it's a
; constant, it can be optimized
